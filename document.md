**Code Explanation**

My code is mostly self explanatory, have added docstrings in the code itself.

[get_access_token]
This function handles authentication and retrieves an access token from the API.

[fetch_data]
This function fetches data from the specified API endpoint, handling pagination automatically.

[transform_data]
This function performs basic data cleaning and transformation, such as renaming columns and filling missing values.

[upload_to_s3]
This function uploads the transformed data to an S3 bucket.

[main]
The main function coordinates the entire ETL process, from extracting data to transforming and uploading it.


*The script demonstrates basic data extraction, transformation, and loading. we expand the transform_data function to include more complex transformations as needed*
*The AWS credentials should be handled securely. we should not add sensitive information directly in the script but now i have just hardcoded because its just dummy data*

**Future Enhancements**
We can implement more sophisticated data transformations and validations.
We can add logging and error handling for better monitoring and debugging.
we can optimize performance for handling larger datasets.

**Conclusion**
This project showcases a fundamental ETL pipeline using Python. It is designed to be scalable and easily extendable for more complex data engineering tasks.
